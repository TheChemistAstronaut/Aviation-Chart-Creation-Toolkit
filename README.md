    Notes : Text labels on chart have been boldened for VR visibility. Runways labeled by default from the vanilla direction the airport spawns in without rotation (18/36), but the airport can be rotated and re-labeled as required. Taxiways labeled as modeled via taxiway signs in-game, with remaining unlabeled taxiways marked via subsequent letters of the alphabet
