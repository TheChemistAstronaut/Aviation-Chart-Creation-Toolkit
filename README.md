# Aviation-Chart-Creation-Toolkit
Charts, templates, and shape libraries included in photoshop (.PSD) format and .PNG

The majority of the fonts used are Futura, which is the font used by the FAA but is not included by default with most windows installations. I downloaded it here - https://freefontsfamily.com/futura-font-family-free/

    Notes : Text labels on chart have been boldened for VR visibility. Runways labeled by default from the vanilla direction the airport spawns in without rotation (18/36), but the airport can be rotated and re-labeled as required. Taxiways labeled as modeled via taxiway signs in-game, with remaining unlabeled taxiways marked via subsequent letters of the alphabet
